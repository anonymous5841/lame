<div class="div1">in div1 : class is being used to call this specific div which is done by .</div>
<div id="divid2">in divid2 : id is being given to call this specific div . main difference between class and id is mostly obvious in java 
    its not that much apparent in css and html.
</div>
<div class="div3">in div3 : difference in class and id is that id is usely said to be given to a specific tag its properties cannot be given to other tags 
    like that we can write the .div1 tag inside the .div2 property providing tag and all the properties that were assigned to the div1 tag in css block will be given 
    to div2 too. while in the case of id this cannot be done as id's properties are specific to that one only, well you can do this will id tag right now but there is more to it.
<div class="div4"></div>
